# Image-segmenation-of-pneumothorax-condition-in-chest-xray-images-of-lungs-using-Unet-model
This Computer Vision project does image segmentation of pneumothorax condition in chest xray images of lungs using Unet model. The path of xray images and mask images should be provided in config.py file to "IMG_PATH" and "MASK_PATH" variables respectively. All images should be in png format. The name of each xray image should match that of its corresponding mask image. Also paths of train and test csvs files should be provided in config.py file. The csv files should have two columns and each row having information of each image. First column with header "new_filename" should have name of the image and second column with header "has_pneumo" with having 1 or 0 value specifing whether the corresponding xray image has pneumothorax condition or not respectively.
